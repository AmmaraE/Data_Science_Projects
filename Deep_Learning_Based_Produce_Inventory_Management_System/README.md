## Abstract
How often have we heard pleas from non-profits organizations to help feed the underprivileged, \
both home and abroad? While many of us are privileged to not be impacted, there are still a \
staggering more than 820 million people for whom food insecurity is a daily struggle. You may be \
inclined to think that there is a global food shortage but you would be surprised to learn that the \
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates one-third of all food \
produced in the world (approximately 1.3 billion tons) is lost or wasted every year. In the U.S. \
alone, an estimated 133 billion pounds of edible food worth over $161 billion goes to waste every \
year. That is approximately 219 pounds of waste per person! \
Food waste does not only exacerbate the obvious problem of food insecurity. Its heavy carbon \
footprint has serious environmental ramifications as well. Any unused produce means that we also \
waste the resources required to grow and transport it: water, energy, fertilizer, labor and \
transportation etc. Once the food is disposed of in a landfill, it rots and becomes a significant \
source of methane - a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. In fact, food waste \
contributes to the largest volume of material in U.S. landfills accounting for 21% of the waste \
stream. In this paper we will demonstrate a proof of concept design which leverages deep-learning \
models on an edge device to help combat the issue of food waste.

## Tools
This project was completed using a custom YOLOV5 model deployed on an NVDIA Jetson Xavier NX . AWS cloud resources have been used for model training and streaming/storing data.
