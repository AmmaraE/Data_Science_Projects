## Objective
Abstract
Experiment-based attempts to document racial prejudice are well represented in academic \
literature. Our study attempts to add to this work by employing a survey-based methodology \
to test whether race influences perceptions of clothing formality; specifically, we show \
subjects four images of the same articles of clothing worn by either a Caucasian or Black \
model, and ask the subjects to rate the clothes’ conformity to the standards of “business \
casual.” Our study did not indicate any significant effect of the model’s race on perceptions of \
clothing across the images we tested. In addition, we did not note any statistically significant \
differences in the perception of subjects of different gender or ethnic groups. As a result, we \
do not claim to have identified any clear implicit biases in this study.
