## Objective
The objective of facial keypoints detection is to predict key point positions on face images. Among other facial features, keypoints include centers and corners of the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth. These key point can be used as a building block in several applications, such as tracking faces in images and video, analyzing facial expressions, detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis, and biometrics or face recognition.  
  
The problem of detecting facial keypoints is challenging. Face images are taken with extreme poses, lighting, and expressions; facial features themselves vary according to size, position, 3D pose and expression, and image conditions also vary with illumination and viewing angle.

## Tools
This project was completed using Python on Google Colab platform.
